								This is a scheduling application I built while studying at WGU.

							<img src="images/authentication.gif" alt="authentication example">
							<p>The scheduler first authenticates the user. This is done so by querying a database of users and pulling the passwords matched with
							the user. If the password matches, access is granted. This assignment assumed this would be used at one of four offices.
						The New York office is displaying because my personal computer is in the Eastern time zone.</p>

							<p>This is the screen to edit and add appointments.</p>
							<img src="images/contact.PNG" alt="manage contacts screen">
							<p>This is the screen to edit and add contacts.</p>

							<p>The main functionality of the program is to act as a CRUD application. The program allows the user to add both contacts and
							appointments.</p>

							<img src="images/warning.gif" alt="a demonstration of the field check">
							<p>Warnings are added if field has problematic information such as an appointment ending before it begins.</p>

							<img src="images/reports.gif" alt="a demonstration of reports and week display">
							<p>Finally, several reports can be run giving a little bit more information on the appointments and contacts that have been entered
								into the system. There is also functionality to display the appointment by week instead of by year.</p>
